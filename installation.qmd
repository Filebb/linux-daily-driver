# Installation

1. Download ISO image of your distribution. I will use
[Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/) 21.3.

2. Create bootable USB drive. On Windows 11 I used
[Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) portable.

3. Boot target device from USB drive.

## First Thing to Do After Installation is Complete

**Upgrade your system!** Open the *Shell* [^1] and run the following commands

[^1]: you can use the keyboard shortcut {{< kbd Ctrl+Alt+T >}}

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt autoremove
```
